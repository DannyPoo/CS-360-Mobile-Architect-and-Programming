The purpose and goals of this app were to make an inventory mangement app so businesses could be maintain their inventory with stock alerts and table system that is easy to use. The UI was kept simple for everyday users and used big icons so it would pop to users. I adopted an iterative approach by working on specific features one at a time and once I completed them I move to the next feature. I employed the MVC design pattern for seperation of concerns and improving code mantainability. I tested the app to make sure every feature worked and could handle it if it didn't work. One challenge I had was developing the UI but I eventually overcame this through more experience and making sure I had my design already done through figma so I could only worry about implementing the code. The user authentication component demonstrates how I can handle a user authentication experience appropiately. The item database shows how I can make a robust database for items and continue to expand it with needed and make sure I have proper error checking.?
